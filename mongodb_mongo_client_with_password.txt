To open the MongoDB client using the root user with a password, you can use the following command:

mongo -u rootUser -p

Replace rootUser with the actual username you created as the root user, and you'll be prompted to enter the password for that user. After entering the correct password, you will be connected to the MongoDB server with root privileges.

Keep in mind that using the root user is powerful and should be done with caution, as it has extensive access to your MongoDB server. It's typically recommended to create and use users with the least privilege required for specific tasks to enhance security.
